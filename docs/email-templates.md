# Email Templates

The majority of email clients either offer no support at all for CSS and floated elements or are inconsistent in how they display them, so email templates should be built using tables. Since designing, building and testing a reliable email template (that works in all email clients) can be a daunting, time-consuming task, we've collected some recommended resources that provide lots of useful information as well as some links to free tried-and-tested email templates that you can customise to your specific needs.
