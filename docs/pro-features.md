# Pro Features

Campaign Pro unlocks the pro features of the Campaign plugin which must also be purchased and installed. Once plugin editions come to the plugin store, these will be merged into a single plugin with two editions.

The following features will be unlocked in Campaign Pro:  

- **[Segments](https://craftcampaign.com/docs/segments)** – sets of conditions that filter contacts by specific fields, operators and values
- **[Automated Sendouts](https://craftcampaign.com/docs/sendouts#sendout-types)** –  delayed sending of campaigns to contacts
- **[Recurring Sendouts](https://craftcampaign.com/docs/sendouts#sendout-types)** –  delayed sending of campaigns to contacts
- **[User Group Sync](https://craftcampaign.com/docs/contacts#creating-contacts)** – synchronised mailing lists with user groups

To install Campaign Pro, search for "Campaign Pro" in the Craft Plugin Store, or install manually using composer.

    composer require putyourlightson/craft-campaign-pro
