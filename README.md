# Craft Campaign

Campaign is an email marketing plugin built specifically for Craft 3. It aims to bring the distribution of content by email into the CMS, where we believe it should be, along with the same ethos of flexibility and user-friendliness that Craft does. 

Learn more at [craftcampaign.com](https://craftcampaign.com).

### Beta
**Campaign is currently in beta, therefore it is not recommend for use in a live production environment.** We aim to release a stable release candidate by the 4th of April 2018, along with the expected launch of Craft CMS 3.0.0 GA.

### Pricing
The Campaign plugin will be available to purchase in the official Craft Plugin Store. Updates will be free, annual renewal fees will be in alignment with the plugin store's guidelines ([plugin store FAQ](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/wiki/Plugin-Store-FAQ)).  
**Campaign: $129**  
**Campaign Pro: $249** ([view pro features](https://craftcampaign.com/docs/pro-features))
